\begin{abstract}
The critical challenge of water resource management in developing regions necessitates innovative monitoring solutions. We present an IoT-enabled edge-to-cloud surveillance system that automates water quality analysis through a remote-controlled aquatic vehicle equipped with multi-parameter sensors (pH, turbidity, temperature, TDS) and multi-model machine learning to address these challenges through four operational paradigms: predictive threat forecasting, pollution source identification, habitat health assessment, and infrastructure risk analysis. Unlike existing manual sampling methods that produce sparse temporal data, our system enables continuous data collection, capturing dynamic water quality fluctuations critical for machine learning applications. The architecture integrates the collected sensor data with Firebase cloud infrastructure, where it undergoes automated preprocessing before feeding into hybrid machine learning models. The machine learning applications include processing of temporal sequences for contamination pattern forecasting, detection of industrial discharge signatures, evaluation of habitat viability against species-specific thresholds and prediction of infrastructure degradation risks from corrosive water conditions. An analytical dashboard synthesizes these outputs into actionable interfaces including parameter visualization maps, contamination event timelines and predictive maintenance alerts. Field surveillance enhances the system's capacity to detect transient pollution events invisible to periodic sampling while generating explainable risk assessments for diverse stakeholders – from aquaculture operators monitoring algal bloom precursors to municipal authorities tracking pipe corrosion trends. By combining robotic mobility with adaptive machine learning, this solution transforms sparse sensor data into strategic insights, creating a scalable framework for water resource stewardship. The open dataset generated through continuous monitoring addresses a critical gap in hydrological research, particularly for developing regions requiring cost-effective alternatives to conventional laboratory analysis.

\section{Introduction}
This project focuses on environmental monitoring, specifically water quality surveillance for the water bodies in and around Guwahati, Assam, through sensor integration, wireless data transmission, and machine learning-based data analysis. Growing populations, industrial expansions, and changes in agricultural practices have pressured water bodies, causing ecological shifts due to chemical runoff, untreated waste, and climate changes. Consequently, water quality monitoring is crucial for environmental stewardship, resource management, and public health.

Traditional water quality assessments rely on manual sampling and laboratory analyses, which are time-consuming and labour-intensive, often resulting in sparse data that fails to capture rapid changes in water quality. With technological advancements, embedded systems, sensor networks, and IoT devices enable real-time, continuous monitoring of environmental parameters. These technologies allow data collection from remote locations, cloud storage, and advanced analytics, such as machine learning models, to interpret and predict water quality trends.

The motivation behind this work stems from several key factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item The absence of comprehensive, publicly accessible datasets for local water bodies in Assam, limiting accurate predictive modeling and comparative studies
\item The shortcomings of existing monitoring methods that rely on infrequent, manual sampling
\item The growing demand for continuous, real-time, and cost-effective monitoring solutions in regions like Assam
\item The need for localized, high-frequency datasets to enable more accurate and context-specific insights
\end{itemize}

Our proposed methodology integrates a manually controlled, 3D-printed boat equipped with on-board sensors (TDS, conductivity, pH, temperature, and turbidity) and wireless communication (ESP32 to Firebase) for dynamic, continuous data collection. The system employs sophisticated LSTM-based predictive analytics for time series forecasting and corrosion risk assessment, alongside a Random Forest model for quality grade assessment, transforming raw measurements into actionable forecasts and classifications.

The primary objective of this work is to develop and implement a manually operated, 3D-printed boat equipped with essential water quality sensors and a reliable wireless communication system to continuously collect, transmit, store, and analyze water quality data in real-time using a cloud-based platform. Secondary objectives include building a robust, region-specific dataset, leveraging machine learning for predictive insights, and providing an expandable framework for other environmental monitoring contexts.

\section{Literature Review}
Recent developments in environmental monitoring have increasingly focused on IoT-enabled distributed sensor networks for real-time, continuous data acquisition from expansive and remote water bodies. The use of microcontrollers like ESP32 has facilitated the development of low-power, effective communication systems that transmit water-quality data to cloud-based platforms, enabling immediate processing and accessibility. Furthermore, the application of LSTM networks has become prevalent for analyzing these data streams, allowing for effective prediction of environmental parameters over time due to their ability to model time-series dependencies.

Research has evolved from fixed-location monitoring stations to mobile platforms like boats, which offer enhanced spatial data collection capabilities. These platforms are particularly beneficial in regions with extensive water bodies where fixed stations cannot adequately capture spatial variations. The integration of various sensors into a single platform using platforms such as Arduino and ESP32 has streamlined data collection processes, allowing for more comprehensive monitoring and simplified deployment.

Recent studies have focused on evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms to determine their suitability for water quality classification tasks. In particular, Random Forest demonstrated superior accuracy (70.12\%) compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (59.14\%) and Decision Trees (58.84\%) due to its ensemble structure, which reduces overfitting and handles non-linear relationships effectively. The application of ensemble learning methods like Random Forest combined with big data frameworks such as PySpark has shown excellent results in predicting water potability, achieving 100\% accuracy and F1-score in some cases.

Advanced LSTM-based architectures integrated with Combined Normalization (LSTM-CN) have been introduced for accurate prediction of water quality parameters, particularly pH. These models utilize wavelet-based time series decomposition and multiple normalization strategies for robust preprocessing, along with attention mechanisms to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in multi-factor datasets. Tested on data from 37 water stations over 705 days, such models have achieved 99.3\% accuracy, 95\% precision, and 93.6\% recall, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Despite these global advancements, specific locales like Assam lack targeted data, which hinders localized prediction and analysis. This project aims to address this gap by creating a new dataset that could serve as a benchmark for future studies, while leveraging the proven effectiveness of IoT, LSTM models, and ensemble learning methods in enhancing real-time water quality monitoring systems.

\section{Conclusion}
This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of continuous, remote water quality monitoring using an integrated hardware-software stack. By employing a floating platform equipped with essential sensors, we reliably collected data from local water bodies and transmitted it to the cloud in near real-time. The results indicate that our system can not only record changing environmental conditions with sufficient temporal granularity but also leverage historical data to generate predictive insights through the LSTM model.

The outcomes confirm that adopting sensor fusion, IoT-driven communication, and machine learning can substantially enhance our understanding of aquatic environments. The integration of multiple parameters into a cohesive dataset provides richer context for interpreting changes in water quality. The LSTM predictions, although continuously improvable, prove the concept that forecasting future parameter values is possible and beneficial. This proactive approach can guide preventive measures, inform policy decisions, and ultimately contribute to more sustainable environmental practices.
