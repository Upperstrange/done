## IEEEtran LaTeX Class Usage Rules

Here are important rules and guidelines for using the IEEEtran LaTeX class, extracted from the provided document:

### General Rules and Best Practices

* This document is applicable to IEEEtran version 1.8b and later; prior versions may not have all features. [cite: 543, 544]
* IEEEtran will display its version number on the user's console during compilation. [cite: 545]
* Do not hyphenate command or file names, and display them in typewriter font. [cite: 556]
* Spaces are not implied at line breaks within command constructs and will be explicitly carried to the next line. [cite: 557]
* A basic working knowledge of LaTeX is assumed; users lacking this are encouraged to read relevant literature. [cite: 560, 561]
* Appendices contain information on installation and avoiding common mistakes. [cite: 565]
* For each category of class options, users must specify an option if the default is not desired. [cite: 569]
* Exercise caution when using `CLASSINPUT` controls, as they can result in documents non-compliant with IEEE standards. [cite: 674]
* `CLASSOPTION`s should be treated as "read-only"; manual alteration can lead to improper formatting. [cite: 683, 684]
* Do not attempt to alter `CLASSINFO`s. [cite: 687]
* Before calling `\maketitle`, all text objects for the title area must be declared. [cite: 689]
* Ensure proper use and control of spaces within `\author` for correct line breaks and spacing. [cite: 696]
* Use nonbreaking spaces (~) to keep name/membership pairs together. [cite: 696]
* Prevent unwanted spaces from appearing between commands with delimited arguments (e.g., curly braces). [cite: 696]
* The `%` symbol should be used to prevent line breaks ending in a command from becoming an unwanted space. [cite: 697]
* For correct dual compilation, use `CLASSOPTION` conditionals to swap order as needed. [cite: 712]
* Authors should ensure all post-processing (PS, PDF, etc.) uses the same paper specification as the TeX document to avoid margin issues. [cite: 639, 640]
* The drawing and graphing tools used should be capable of direct output in vector (EPS or PDF) format. [cite: 288]
* For photos, IEEE recommends EPS/PDF, PNG, or TIFF; JPEG is usually acceptable for author photos. [cite: 290, 291]
* Graphic formats like BMP, EMF, VSD are unacceptable for IEEE journals. [cite: 291]
* TeX will not allow unmatched braces within command arguments; they must be provided within the cells if needed. [cite: 324, 325]
* If no width argument is provided, a box will be set to its natural width, and rubber inter-column glue is not required. [cite: 349]
* Unless otherwise noted, commands described for rows must be issued as the very first command in a given row. [cite: 408]

### Document Modes and Options

* `IEEEtran` can produce conference, journal, and technical note papers using suitable class options. [cite: 539]
* `10pt` text is used by most papers, with `9pt` for technote papers and `11pt` for initial conference submissions. [cite: 572]
* IEEE Computer Society publications use "PostScript" (bp) point sizes rather than traditional typesetters' points. [cite: 573]
* `IEEEtran` automatically adjusts font size based on the document mode. [cite: 573]
* If figures are desired in draft mode, use the `draftcls` option to confine the draft mode within `IEEEtran`. [cite: 578]
* When using draft modes, most users will also want to select the `onecolumn` option. [cite: 581]
* Journal and technote modes produce papers similar to IEEE TRANSACTIONS journals. [cite: 583]
* When using `technote` mode, most users should also select the `9pt` option. [cite: 584]
* Peer review options require `\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle` after `\maketitle` (usually after the abstract) to end the cover page. This command is ignored in non-peerreview modes. [cite: 587, 588]
* Conference mode increases margins and reduces text height to about 9.25in, with the bottom margin larger for IEEE clearance. [cite: 591, 592]
* In conference mode, headings and page numbers are not displayed in headers or footers. [cite: 594]
* Author text in conference mode is placed in a modified tabular environment for multicolumn formatting. [cite: 596, 597]
* Spacing after author names and around section names is reduced in conference mode. [cite: 598]
* Special paper notices (if used) appear between author names and title in conference papers (after title for journals). [cite: 599]
* Figure captions are centered in conference mode. [cite: 600]
* Certain commands (`\thanks`, `\IEEEPARstart`, `\IEEEbiography`, etc.) are disabled in conference mode but can be re-enabled with `\IEEEoverridecommandlockouts`. [cite: 601]
* Reminder and warning notices for camera-ready work are enabled in conference mode. [cite: 602]
* When using conference mode, users typically equalize columns on the last page. [cite: 603]
* Comsoc mode primarily affects the math font to match Times Roman text. [cite: 605]
* For comsoc mode, Michael Sharpe's `newtxmath` package (v1.451+ recommended) or commercial MathTime fonts are acceptable. `IEEEtran` will attempt to enforce their use if not loaded. [cite: 606, 607]
* The `cmintegrals` option for `newtxmath` is needed for the specific integral symbol style used by IEEE Communications Society. [cite: 608]
* The `bm` package provides selective bold math. [cite: 609]
* The AMS Math `amssymb.sty` package is not needed and should not be loaded as its functionality is built into `newtxmath` and MathTime. [cite: 610]
* Do not load `newtxtext.sty` as it alters the main text font. [cite: 611]
* Unless specifically instructed by the conference, do not invoke the `comsoc` option with conference papers. [cite: 613]
* Compsoc mode changes the default text font to Palatino/Palladio (non-conference modes only), revises margins, and uses Arabic section numbering. [cite: 615, 616]
* `IEEEcompsocitemizethanks` and `\IEEEcompsocthanksitem` are enabled for author affiliations in compsoc mode. [cite: 616]
* `\IEEEtitleabstractindextext` is enabled for single-column abstract and index terms in compsoc mode. [cite: 617]
* Be aware that many IEEE Computer Society conferences use the traditional conference format; `compsoc` mode should not be used with them. [cite: 623]
* In `transmag` mode, `\author` text should be entered in the long form as in conference mode. [cite: 624]
* `\IEEEauthorrefmark` will produce Arabic author affiliation symbols in `transmag` mode. [cite: 626]
* Subsection and subsubsection headings/spacings are slightly different in `transmag` mode, and a smaller, bold font is used for the title. [cite: 626, 627]
* `transmag` mode (and standard journal mode) is acceptable for IEEE Magnetics Letters submission. [cite: 628]
* Authors can use `endfloat.sty` [13] to place figures and tables at the end of the paper. [cite: 629]
* IEEEtran supports US letter and A4 paper sizes. [cite: 630]
* Authors should usually select `letterpaper` for IEEE submissions unless specified otherwise. [cite: 631]
* Changing paper size in standard journal/conference modes affects only margins, not typesetting. [cite: 632]
* `a4paper` results in reduced side margins and a longer bottom margin compared to US letter. [cite: 633]
* Top margins remain the same and text is horizontally centered for both `letterpaper` and `a4paper`. [cite: 634]
* In `compsoc` conference and draft modes, margins remain constant, and text area size varies with paper size changes. [cite: 635]
* The `cspaper` option is a special "trim" size for IEEE Computer Society journals and does not alter typesetting in `compsoc` journal mode. [cite: 636, 637]
* Invoke `cspaper` only if requested by editors. [cite: 638]
* Dvips systems require a specific entry in `config.ps` for `ieeecs` paper size. [cite: 641]
* Running headings differ based on `oneside` vs. `twoside` options due to centered side margins. [cite: 644]
* The `onecolumn` option is mainly for draft papers, as IEEE typically uses two columns. [cite: 646]
* `IEEEtran` defaults to alphabetical appendices; use the `romanappendices` option for Roman numbering. [cite: 647]
* The `captionsoff` option inhibits caption display in figures and tables while preserving `\label` operation, useful for journals requiring captionless figures/tables at the document's end. [cite: 648, 649, 650, 651]
* Figure placement with `captionsoff` can be achieved with `endfloat.sty`. [cite: 652]
* The TPE journal has specific formatting needs that require `draftclassnofoot`, `onecolumn`, and `\newpage` before sections/bibliography. [cite: 652]
* These commands can be conditionally enabled via `\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff`. [cite: 653]
* `IEEEtran` normally adjusts interword spacing for better appearance; `nofonttune` disables this. [cite: 654, 655, 656]
* `nofonttune` is only for those using fonts specifically designed for two-column work. [cite: 657]
* The paragraph section is not allowed for technotes or compsoc conferences due to nesting depth restrictions. [cite: 109]

### Title Page and Author Information

* Titles are generally capitalized, except for small words (a, an, and, etc.) unless they are the first or last word. [cite: 691]
* Line breaks (`\\`) can be used to equalize title line lengths. [cite: 692]
* Do not use math or special symbols in the title. [cite: 693]
* Since `\thanks` is not designed for multiple paragraphs, use a separate `\thanks` for each paragraph. [cite: 695, 696]
* Regular line breaks (`\\`) can be used within `\thanks`. [cite: 696]
* If more than three authors or text is too wide, use the alternate long format for author names. [cite: 705]
* `\IEEEauthorrefmark{}` generates a footnote symbol to link author names to affiliations. [cite: 706, 707]
* No need to prevent spaces between `\IEEEAuthorblock`s as TeX ignores spaces at line ends/starts. [cite: 708]
* For IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, use conference long format for author names, keeping name/address pairs on one line without emails or phone numbers. [cite: 714]
* Authors should not include name information in headings of anonymous peer review papers. [cite: 718]
* `IEEEpubid()` is useful to see unavailable title page text area, especially for technote papers. [cite: 718, 719, 720]
* If `\IEEEpubid()` is used, `\IEEEpubidadjcol` must be issued in the second column of the title page. [cite: 721]
* `IEEEpubid{}` is disabled in conference mode as authors do not place publication IDs on camera-ready papers. [cite: 724]
* In conference mode, `IEEEtran` automatically increases the bottom margin for IEEE marks. [cite: 725]
* In draft mode, the publisher ID mark is not printed but room is cleared. [cite: 726]
* Authors should be aware that `IEEEtran` calculates spacing to ensure integer number of lines on the first page, unless margins are overridden. [cite: 732]
* Failure to do so can cause underfull vbox errors. [cite: 733]
* `\IEEEaftertitletext{}` contents bypass dynamic title spacing, so manual height tweaking may be needed to avoid underfull vbox warnings. [cite: 734]

### Abstract and Index Terms

* Math, special symbols, and/or citations should generally not be used in abstracts. [cite: 736]
* Do not use math or special symbols in the keywords. [cite: 101]

### Equations and Algorithms

* In TeX's math mode, spacing around operators can be inhibited (e.g., `{=}`) or forced (`{ }={ }`). [cite: 137]
* Empty ords do not have width but cause TeX to place space around operators. [cite: 138]
* Set `\arraycolsep` to zero to prevent unwanted inter-column spacing in `eqnarray`. [cite: 139]
* Placing empty ords around the equal sign forces correct natural spacing. [cite: 140]
* Do not use the floating algorithm environment of `algorithm.sty` or `algorithm2e.sty`, as figures and tables are the only floating structures IEEE uses. [cite: 149]
* `IEEEtran` will not control the caption style produced by these float environments. [cite: 150]
* To correct underfull vbox errors on pages with double-column floats, manually tweak space with commands like `\vspace*{-3pt}` within the double-column structure. [cite: 163]
* The IEEE rarely uses double column equations because they can waste space. [cite: 166]
* Most IEEE papers use sequential theorem numbering; `in_counter` is usually not specified. [cite: 210]
* If `in_counter` is used, it's typically "section" so the section number prefixes the theorem number. [cite: 211]

### Tables and Figures

* When creating tables, especially with vertical rules, vertical space between rows is generally undesirable as it can suspend column cell definitions and cut across vertical rules. [cite: 362]
* `IEEEeqnarray/box` commands manage struts in a hidden column to keep rows adequately spaced. [cite: 364]
* The default strut height and depth are usually zero. [cite: 366]
* Users can set default strut values using `\IEEEeqnarraystrutsize{height}{depth}[decl]` in a local or global control. [cite: 367]
* The optional argument for `\IEEEeqnarraystrutsize` is for commands executed before height and depth evaluation. [cite: 368]
* For mimicking `\baselineskip`, recommended strut height and depth are 70% and 30% of `\normalbaselineskip`, respectively. `\IEEEeqnarraystrutsize` assumes these if arguments are blank. [cite: 373, 374]
* Empty arguments for strut commands are assumed to be 0 pt. [cite: 377]
* For diagnostic purposes, `\IEEEvisiblestrutstrue` can be placed within `\IEEEeqnarray/box` or `\IEEEstrut` to make struts visible. [cite: 380]
* When using `\IEEEeqnarraybox` for tables with vertical lines, it's usually desirable to shut down the `\baselineskip` system and use pure strut spacing. [cite: 381, 383]
* The `\IEEEeqnarraystrutmode` command can be used for this purpose. [cite: 385]
* Use `%` to prevent line endings in braces from being interpreted as unwanted spaces. [cite: 384]
* `\IEEEeqnarraymulticol{num_cols}{col_type}{text}` is used to override column types within a row. [cite: 386, 388]
* The third argument of `\IEEEeqnarraymulticol` must be enclosed in extra braces if the column type acquires it as an argument. [cite: 389]
* Do not use commands like `\multicolumn` designed for other alignment environments. [cite: 389]
* In the `IEEEeqnarray` family, rules are declared and treated as normal column types, not hidden. [cite: 390]
* Rule column types use `\arrayrulewidth` for thickness and `\doublerulesep` for double rule spacing. [cite: 392]
* Horizontal rule types are typically used with `\IEEEeqnarraymulticol` to draw rules across columns. [cite: 400]
* Line commands from other alignment environments may not work properly within the `IEEEeqnarray` family. [cite: 401]
* `\cline` is incompatible; use `\IEEEeqnarraymulticol{num_cols}{h}{}` instead. [cite: 402]
* `\vline` and `\hline` should work unless redefined by another LaTeX package. [cite: 403]
