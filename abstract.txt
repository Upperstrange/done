ABSTRACT
The critical challenge of water resource management in developing regions necessitates innovative monitoring solutions. We present an IoT-enabled edge-to-cloud surveillance system that automates water quality analysis through a remote-controlled aquatic vehicle equipped with multi-parameter sensors (pH, turbidity, temperature, TDS) and multi-model machine learning to address these challenges through four operational paradigms: predictive threat forecasting, pollution source identification, habitat health assessment, and infrastructure risk analysis. Unlike existing manual sampling methods that produce sparse temporal data, our system enables continuous data collection, capturing dynamic water quality fluctuations critical for machine learning applications. The architecture integrates the collected sensor data with Firebase cloud infrastructure, where it undergoes automated preprocessing before feeding into hybrid machine learning models. The machine learning applications include processing of temporal sequences for contamination pattern forecasting, detection of industrial discharge signatures, evaluation of habitat viability against species-specific thresholds and prediction of infrastructure degradation risks from corrosive water conditions. An analytical dashboard synthesizes these outputs into actionable interfaces including parameter visualization maps, contamination event timelines and predictive maintenance alerts. Field surveillance enhances the system’s capacity to detect transient pollution events invisible to periodic sampling while generating explainable risk assessments for diverse stakeholders – from aquaculture operators monitoring algal bloom precursors to municipal authorities tracking pipe corrosion trends. By combining robotic mobility with adaptive machine learning, this solution transforms sparse sensor data into strategic insights, creating a scalable framework for water resource stewardship. The open dataset generated through continuous monitoring addresses a critical gap in hydrological research, particularly for developing regions requiring cost-effective alternatives to conventional laboratory analysis.
