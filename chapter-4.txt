RESULT ANALYSIS
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents and interprets the outcomes obtained from the water quality monitoring system and the predictive analytics model developed. It begins with the presentation of the collected datasets and model predictions in graphical or tabular formats. Following this, each result is explained in detail, emphasizing the trends, patterns, and anomalies noted. We will also discuss the relevance of these findings in real-world decision-making, address any discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes, and offer justifications for these differences. The chapter concludes with insights into the system’s current performance and future improvements.
4.2 Result Analysis
The results analyzed here encompass both the raw sensor measurements gathered from multiple trials and timeframes and the predictions generated by the LSTM model. Data was collected continuously over a set period, enabling us to develop a rich historical dataset of water parameters. The key parameters—pH, turbidity, TDS, temperature, and conductivity—were recorded and then predicted for future time intervals using the trained LSTM model.

The time-series plots reveal certain patterns, such as a slight increase in turbidity following rainfall events, indicated by spikes in the plotted turbidity line. pH values remain relatively stable but show minor diurnal variations possibly influenced by biological activity in the water. Temperature data aligns with ambient environmental conditions, rising during daylight hours and dropping at night. When examining the predictions, we see that the LSTM model can forecast general trends in water parameters. For instance, the model accurately anticipates rising turbidity after heavy rainfall patterns are established in the training data. Similarly, predicted temperature values closely follow the diurnal cycle observed in historical measurements. The system achieved accurate predictions, particularly for temperature, with a predictive performance score of 0.9716. The error metrics table reveals that while the model’s RMSE and MAE are generally low, implying that the predicted values are close to actual measurements, certain parameters may exhibit slightly higher errors. This suggests that the model captures some parameters better than others, potentially due to differences in data variability or sensor noise.
4.4 Significance of the Results Obtained:
These results carry substantial environmental and managerial significance. The ability to reliably measure and predict water quality parameters in real time helps us identify emerging contamination events, schedule water treatment interventions, and implement early warning mechanisms for public health safety. By understanding the interplay between different parameters, environmental agencies can make informed decisions about conservation measures, resource allocation, and long-term environmental planning. The predictive component, supported by machine learning, provides a forward-looking perspective on water quality trends. Such forecasts allow for proactive strategies rather than reactive responses. For example, if the model predicts a sharp rise in turbidity or a drop in pH over the coming hours or days, remedial actions can be planned.
4.5 Deviations from Expected Results and Justifications:
While the system’s predictions and measured parameters align reasonably well, a few deviations occurred. For instance, turbidity predictions showed sudden discrepancies following atypical weather events not well represented in the training data. The model may assume standard seasonal patterns; unusual environmental disturbances can lead to prediction errors. Minor sensor drift over time can also introduce biases in the data. To mitigate these issues we have carried out, regular sensor maintenance, recalibration, and periodic retraining of the model with updated datasets.
4.6 Conclusions
The results confirm that the integrated hardware-software approach effectively monitors water quality in real-time and that the LSTM model can capture and predict general trends for each parameter. While the overall performance is encouraging, certain challenges—like unexpected environmental anomalies and sensor-related deviations—underscore the need for continuous refinement. Future work may focus on incorporating more diverse training data, optimizing model architectures, and implementing feedback loops for dynamic model updates.
The outcomes presented in this chapter provide a solid baseline for further improvements. They highlight the system’s potential for enhancing environmental resource management through data-driven insights, forecasting capabilities, and a robust foundation for future research and development.
